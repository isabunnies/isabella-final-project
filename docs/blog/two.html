      <h1>My Life in Japan! And a Love Letter to My Second Home</h1>

<p>In spring 2024, I had the incredible opportunity to study abroad at Sophia University in Tokyo, and it was one of the most unforgettable experiences of my life. But my life in Tokyo wasn’t all glitz and glamour– far from it.</p>

  

  
    
<p>There were moments where I was incredibly lonely, I had never been so far from home, and my from loved ones, for such a prolonged period of time. Japanese culture and society is also vastly different from the culture in the U.S. too, it’s very strict and rigid. Only until the very end of my 6-month-long journey did I finally get used to it. There were a lot of moments where I felt like all eyes were watching my every move, especially living as a foreigner in such a homogenous society.</p>

  

  
    
<p>What eventually became important to me, was the feeling of home. And the city where I lived, Azabu-Juban, became a second home to me during my time studying abroad. I know every street, every shop, in my little neighborhood of Azabu-Juban. It also wasn’t uncommon to see foreigners in the area too, as Azabu-Juban houses a plethora of international embassies. I was mere steps away from the Korean, Australian, Iranian, and Portuguese embassies. The American embassy was a couple of train-stops away.</p>

  

  
    
<p>With Azabu-Juban’s international population, it was also home to the most famous international grocery stores in Tokyo, too. If I ever missed Hot Cheetos or American cheese, (very rare items in Japan!) I was lucky enough to have a fix nearby.</p>

  

  
    
<p>Additionally, I made sure to utilize the public resources Azabu-Juban offered as well. The city office offered specialty Japanese classes for foreigners who lived in the area on the weekends, and had Japanese language exchange programs as well. These were really helpful resources that allowed me to improve my Japanese outside of university classes, and for a really affordable price too!</p>

  

  
    
<p>So if you ever want a taste of home in Tokyo, look no further than taking a trip to Azabu-Juban, it’s a culturally rich area in the heart of Tokyo with a lot of international influence, you won’t want to miss it!</p>
