      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hi! My name's Isabella, and I've been studying Japanese for around 3.5 years. This blog is a collection of my experiences of studying Japanese, including some highlights from my study abroad in Japan. I hope you find something useful from this website-- whether it be my reviews on certain language learning methods and tools, or some stand-out restaraunts and cafes I encountered during my stay in Tokyo.</p>
      
      <p>A little more info about me, I'm a fourth-year journalism and international relations student at The University of Texas at Austin. I'm also getting minors in both in Japanese and international business. When I'm not buried in schoolwork, I love to read fantasy novels, learn new languages, and if money allows, I love to travel!</p>
      
      <p>Learning Japanese can be a struggle, it certainly is for me, even after all these years. Overcoming the mountainous task of memorizing 2,500+ kanji, learning the complexities of the Japanese social hierarchy embedded within the language, and getting used to the strict Japanese cultural customs are just a fraction of the challenges I've encountered while studying Japanese. But I hope sharing my experience can provide some helpful insight to others who are also trekking on their language learning journey. Whether you're wanting to master the language, or just passing by to learn some tips for your upcoming trip to Japan, I have a little something for everyone!</p>
